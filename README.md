# Smart Trolley System

 
A mobile application designed to support a smart trolley system. Shoppers can access the app by scanning the QR code on the trolley and then add items by scanning them with the inbuilt barcode scanner. To ensure accuracy, load cells mounted on the trolley legs verify the items being added. All scanned items are stored in Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB) and displayed dynamically within the app providing users a seamless real-time view of their cart contents.
