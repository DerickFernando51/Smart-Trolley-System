# Smart Trolley System

 
A mobile application that supports a smart shopping trolley system. The app can be accessed by scanning the QR code on the shopping cart, allowing users to add items using the inbuilt barcode scanner. To ensure accuracy, load cells mounted on the trolley legs verify the items being added. All scanned items are stored in Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB), and the application uses a RecyclerView to display this data dynamically, providing users with a seamless real-time view of their cart contents.
